exercice4: assertion: Assertions are used at development time. They let you test your assumptions before 
           deployment. The assertion code evaporates when the program is deployed.
           private void methodA(int num){
           assert(num>=0):""; //throws an assertion if it's not true!!!
           useNum(num+x); 
           }
***NOTE:
Assertions are typically disabled by default in Java.
To enable assertions in Java, you need to use the -ea or -enableassertions flag 
java -ea Ex4
